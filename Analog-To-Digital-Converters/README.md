Analog To Digital Converters (ADC)
==================================


In the first week you have gained an understanding of how to utilize an Arduino IO Board (and it's microcontroller) to control digital outputs: digital write, for loops, and triggering the Ultrasonic by wobbling the voltage signal from low to high (on trigPin).

Recall that Digital is only ever at High or Low, and there was another class of signals -- known as Analog signals -- which have HIGH and LOW and every value in between. 

We will talk how to convert a <em>continuous</em> signal to a digital one.


### ADC

You can try to represent a continuous value digitally by rounding.
