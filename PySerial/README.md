Enter the Python
================

Utilizing the pyserial and other python libraries, we will be able to create programs which have more potential than our 
Arduino IDE alone.


####Now you can:
1. Connect your project to the internet.
2. You can log data and do science.
3. Virtually increase the complexity of your Arduino programs.

...plus you get to use Python -- which is awesome!
